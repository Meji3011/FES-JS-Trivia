    Everything is in the JS file, check with console.
    <br />
    Uncomment functions if necessary to see the console logs.
    <br />
    Remember that in JS code gets executed line by line in order.
    <br />
    Most code bases uses only const and let, because let is block scope, which prevents unwanted variable usage beyond the scope it is in.
    Const makes an object that is immutable, it can be modified but cannot be re-declared.
    <br />
    Remember to always practice and be fresh on JS. A master has failed more than a beginner has tried.
